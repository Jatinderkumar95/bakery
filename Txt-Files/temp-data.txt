TempData is a storage container for data that needs to be available to a separate HTTP request. The example for illustrating how TempData works involves providing feedback form to the user after a form submission that results in the user being redirected to another page (Post-Redirect-Get).

Here is a very simple form:

<form method="post">
    <input type="text" asp-for="EmailAddress"/>
    <span asp-validation-for="EmailAddress"></span><br/>
    <button>Submit</button>
</form>
